[Paul] How is she?

338
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,412
[Jessica] She was frightened,
but she's...

339
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,081
she's okay.

You're so close now.

348
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,383
Only one step remains
and you will become
the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

349
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,253
Only one step remains.

350
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,855
You must do what I did.

351
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,192
You must drink
the Water of Life.

352
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,895
And your mind,
it's gon-- it's gonna open

with us, first thing,
you must learn

355
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,547
to be one with the desert.

356
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:44,552
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

357

beware of the trapdoor spiders.

365
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:08,876
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

366
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,545
They are harmless.

367
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:14,248

you have to worry about.
And... Oh!

Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

388
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,066
[Chani] You have to break up
your rhythm.

Like this.

because in the filmbooks
I've studied,

in order to properly sandwalk,
you actually have--

you won't make it two weeks.

If you wanna follow us
in the desert,

397
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,524
you need to know

it captures the moisture

into that pocket.

Uh, and these are the filters.

Sometimes it rains

Where you see sand here,
imagine water.

Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

you can't reach the bottom.

What does that mean?

540
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,915
Means Desert Spring.

It's from some stupid prophecy.

-[Paul] Yeah.

No. Only Fremen ride worms.

Well, I thought I'd become one,
didn't I?

550
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,878
By name, not by blood.

Your blood comes

We don't have that here.

Here, we're equal,

What we do,
we do for the benefit of all.

She's asking why.

01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,425
Because I must continue

to protect you down
there in the South.

It's not a prophecy.

Paul Atreides
is still alive.

1466
02:06:50,878 --> 02:06:52,379
He challenges my father.

1467
02:06:53,848 --> 02:06:55,616
You've never been
on Arrakis.

1468
02:06:57,084 --> 02:06:59,086
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

1469
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,721
Was this all upon
your advice?

1470
02:07:00,754 --> 02:07:02,790
What?

1471
02:07:02,823 --> 02:07:05,860
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

1472
02:07:05,893 --> 02:07:09,230
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

1473
02:07:09,263 --> 02:07:11,699
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

1474
02:07:11,732 --> 02:07:13,801
And I was right
to do it.

1475
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:16,971
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

1476
02:07:17,004 --> 02:07:19,240
that our world
has not yet seen.

1477
02:07:19,273 --> 02:07:21,876
The ultimate power.

1478
02:07:21,909 --> 02:07:23,744
For ninety generations,

1479
02:07:23,777 --> 02:07:25,813
we have supervised
House Atreides.

1480
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:28,916
They were promising,
but they were becoming
dangerously defiant.

1481
02:07:28,949 --> 02:07:32,386
Their bloodline
had to be terminated.

1482
02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:34,889
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

1483
02:07:34,922 --> 02:07:35,956
Several prospects.

1484
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:37,424
But it's backfired.

1485
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:39,160
Paul is alive.

1486
02:07:39,193 --> 02:07:41,128
And if
he defeats Feyd-Rautha,
my father--

1487
02:07:41,162 --> 02:07:45,366
Your father
will lose the throne
no matter who prevails.

1488
02:07:45,399 --> 02:07:48,402
But there is one way
your family can remain
in power

1489
02:07:48,435 --> 02:07:51,872
and, through you,
the continuation
of our stewardship.

1490
02:07:52,973 --> 02:07:54,842
One. Way.

1491
02:07:55,442 --> 02:07:57,945
Are you prepared?

1492
02:07:57,978 --> 02:08:00,681
You've been preparing me
my whole life,
Reverend Mother.

1493
02:08:02,983 --> 02:08:05,286
You're heading north
with the others?

1494
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:07,254
I'm Fedaykin.

1495
02:08:07,288 --> 02:08:09,990
I follow my leaders.
If fighting goes north,
I go north.

1496
02:08:10,024 --> 02:08:11,392
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

1497
02:08:11,425 --> 02:08:14,061
I won't be fighting for him.

1498
02:08:14,094 --> 02:08:15,396
I'm fighting for my people.

1499
02:08:19,266 --> 02:08:21,101
I came to wish you
best of luck.

1500
02:08:22,369 --> 02:08:23,938
I'd wish you the same,

1501
02:08:25,906 --> 02:08:27,474
but it seems
you've won your battle.

1502

[whooshing]

1503
02:08:50,798 --> 02:08:52,099
[Gurney] He took the bait.

1504
02:08:58,839 --> 02:09:00,774
[Paul] Oh, the Emperor's
very obliging.

1505
02:09:01,809 --> 02:09:03,377
He's right on time.

What is he doing here?

1509
02:09:38,879 --> 02:09:40,981
I brought spice production
under control.

1510
02:09:44,151 --> 02:09:45,319
What do we do?

1511
02:09:46,887 --> 02:09:49,591
Send messages
to the Great Houses.

1512
02:09:49,624 --> 02:09:53,861
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

1513
02:09:53,894 --> 02:09:56,564
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

1514
02:10:20,487 --> 02:10:22,423
[whispering in Chakobsa]

1515
02:10:23,924 --> 02:10:26,427
[Paul] When the storm
hits this ridge,

1516
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:28,929
Gurney will open
the way for you, Stilgar,

1517
02:10:28,962 --> 02:10:31,231
so you can enter
the basin from the West

1518
02:10:31,265 --> 02:10:33,601
and distract
their defense systems.

1519
02:10:33,635 --> 02:10:35,436
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

1520
02:10:35,469 --> 02:10:36,970
to then attack
from the East,

1521
02:10:37,938 --> 02:10:39,973
inside the basin.

1522
02:10:40,007 --> 02:10:42,109
I'll strike
from the North,
head on,

1523
02:10:42,142 --> 02:10:44,211
with the Fundamentalist troops.

1524
02:10:44,244 --> 02:10:47,081
And I'll serve Arrakeen
for dessert.

1525
02:10:47,114 --> 02:10:49,283
Remember,
I need the Emperor alive.

That's all we know.

More. More. Give me more.

[Feyd-Rautha]
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is dead.

1543
02:12:24,746 --> 02:12:27,749
Or he went hiding
in the Southern storms

1544
02:12:27,782 --> 02:12:29,450
which means the same thing.

[Bashar] Your Majesty,

1547
02:12:31,786 --> 02:12:33,320
the sand storm

We recommend
going back into orbit.

Well, the mountains
will protect us

Baron, have you
ever investigated

02:12:48,202 --> 02:12:51,539
the south regions
of Arrakis?

1554

Well, the entire region
is uninhabitable.
